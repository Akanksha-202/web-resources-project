Web Resource Hub is an open-source project developed for the DevJam Hackathon organized by Social Summer of Code. It serves as a comprehensive collection of frontend web resources, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The project aims to provide developers with a centralized platform to access a wide range of frontend tools and resources, making their development process more efficient and productive.
